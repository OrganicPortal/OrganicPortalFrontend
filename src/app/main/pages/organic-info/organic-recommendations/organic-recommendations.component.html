	<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scenarios for transitioning to organic production</h2>
	
	<p>If the investor has already decided on the field of organic production (growing grains, berries, vegetables or
	   animal husbandry) and has clear requirements for the terrain and soils, layered overlaying of electronic maps will
	   allow the farmer to offer the most suitable arrays for the chosen type of activity. Family farms have a local
	   location and are very often tied to the farmer's place of residence, at the planning stage of introducing organic
	   farming, a different algorithm of actions is used (Fig. 1, 2).</p>

	<p>First of all, for organic production, investors try to attract land from the reserve (fallow) or land that has not
	   been cultivated for a long time. In this case, the transition period can be reduced to 2 years (the minimum
	   period). As a result of such natural land reclamation, the agrochemical condition of the land stabilizes or
	   improves naturally without human intervention, in particular: the biological activity of the soil increases, the
	   structure improves, the amount of alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen increases, the content of mobile forms of phosphorus
	   and exchangeable potassium stabilizes, which will ensure a sufficiently high level of crop yield. The disadvantage
	   of using such land may be a large number of pests that have lived and multiplied safely for many years. Quite
	   often, the process of natural afforestation begins on fallow or pastures, which will complicate and increase the
	   costs of putting the site into operation.</p>

	<p>In organic production, natural factors have a much greater impact on the quantity and quality of the harvest
	   compared to
	   traditional agricultural production. One of the main disadvantages of the development of organic production is
	   losses in the transition period caused by a decrease in crop yields due to the abandonment of mineral fertilizers
	   and
	   pesticides.</p>
	
	<p>The humus content in the soil is one of the main criteria for assessing the suitability of a site for use in
	   organic
	   production. Its role is not limited to a source of nutrients for plants. The humus content affects the structure,
	   water-holding capacity and thermal properties of the soil, promotes the development of beneficial soil
	   microorganisms, and improves
	   physiological processes of plants.</p>
	
	<p>To bring the humus content in a particular field to the optimal (planned) level, it is necessary to increase the
	   flow of fresh organic matter into the
	   soil (surface and root residues, organic fertilizers, biohumus, composts, manure only from
	   organic animals). Therefore, scientifically substantiated
	   crop rotation, the correct system of soil cultivation, timeliness and quality of technological operations,
	   selection
	   of crops, plowing up plant residues, and the use of biological products are of key importance for regulating the
	   balance of humus. Therefore, when planning the transition or the beginning of organic
	   production, it is worth assessing the agrochemical condition of the soils, the potential crop yield, costs and
	   risks.
		<a [routerLink]="'/organic-map'">The E-calculator for crop yield forecast will help you with this</a>. It has been
	   proven
	   that it is economically
	   profitable to start organic production on fertile soils that are not contaminated with radionuclides or pesticide
	   residues.
	   It is worth starting to grow organic grains when the area is at least 50 hectares. If the area is not large, 2-5
	   hectares, it is worth
	   considering niche or berry crops.</p>

	<p>In the event that it is not possible to effectively protect plants from pests and diseases by preventive measures,
	   products approved for use (Annex II to the Standard, which is equivalent to the EU Standard) are provided for. In
	   this case, operators
	   must have documentary confirmation of the need to use such products.</p>
	
	<p>When using authorized products, the operator must: take appropriate preventive or precautionary measures,
	   document all measures taken (type of measure, place of implementation, results, name of the responsible person),
	   and
	   describe the current situation with pests and weeds on the farm (specify the type of pests, date and place of
	   infestation, infected products, etc.).</p>
	
	<p>If the purchased products are not included in this list, they must be approved by the certification body
	   before<strong>
			starting their use.</strong> Before using the above substances, the operator must:</p>
	
	<ul class="wp-block-list">
		<li>notify the relevant certification body;</li>
		
		<li>provide a description of the application method, application rates and application site;</li>
		
		<li>recommended waiting period after application if not specified in the product specification;</li>
		
		<li>documentation describing the operator’s planned measures to avoid contamination of organic products;</li>
		
		<li>in the case where an external company is hired to control pests and weeds, the documentation itself should be
		    available.<strong></strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Soil organic matter is divided into active (labile), slow and passive (stable) pools depending on
	   the duration of the “life” of chemical compounds in the soil (MRT). In the active pool, MRT is from several months
	   to 3 years,
	   in the slow one it increases to 15-20 years and over 1000 years –&nbsp; in the passive one. At the same time,
	   between the mentioned pools
	   there is a constant exchange of organic substances, which is accompanied by the mineralization of part of organic
	   compounds with
	   the release of CO<sub>2 </sub> and, conversely, the immobilization of nutrients into organic forms.</p>
	
	<p>It is the active (labile) humus that serves as a source of the most accessible nutrients for plants, plays the role
	   of
	   an energy-plastic buffer of the soil and is a material for the creation of stable humus substances. Its deficiency
	   in the soil
	   contributes to greater decomposition of stable humus (soil dehumification). And the reproduction of soil fertility
	   is possible provided that it is ensured a deficit-free balance of organic matter. Balance calculations in
	   agriculture are the basis for assessing the conditions of humus accumulation. They make it possible to control the
	   replenishment of soil with fresh organic matter, predict changes in the humus state, and regulate the processes of
	   transformation of soil organic matter.
